# Dynamic visualization of Austrian voting data

In this project D3.js is used to create a dynamic visualization.
A pie chart and a choropleth map is created and both views are linked.

## Info for running

The project was created and tested using WebStorm.
No server to host the index.html is included in the repository. Thus, loading of the csv file is not possible by just opening the index.html.

## Example pictures of visualization
